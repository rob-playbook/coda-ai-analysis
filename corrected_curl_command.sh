    "content": "<1586\n\nColin: Okay, thank you. Great. So that is over and done with. Awesome. So today is really just going to be 60 minutes and we'\''re hoping to just learn from you, basically.>\n\n<1587\n\nGeorge: Okay.>\n\n<1588\n\nColin: It'\''s basically going to help us learn about your, you know, what sort of are the thorns in your side, this kind of thing, so we can help PBK builds better tools basically.>\n\n<1589\n\nGeorge: I wasn'\''t prepared to do any demos or screen share or have prepared any screen shots of anything, but be happy to walk through That'\''s totally fine.>\n\n<1590\n\nColin: So just over on the page, there was no expectation for you to have prepared anything, so don'\''t worry about that.>\n\n<1591\n\nGeorge: Oh, that'\''s um feel is that really the agenda though? That'\''s doesn'\''t really feel like the agenda of our of our discussion here today.>\n\n<1592\n\nColin: That'\''s our fault if for some reason we weren'\''t clear with that then that'\''s totally our fault. I apologize. The goal of the project is basically to help PBKs develop a new platform that helps across the whole life cycle.>\n\n<1593\n\nGeorge: Of course, I'\''m just letting you know, the expectations of the meeting are not aligned with what I was, I thought I was going to give you feedback on how the tool is supposed to>\n\n<1594\n\nColin: That is just a generic term.>\n\n<1595\n\nGeorge: We do not actually have a physical platform. Our organizational structure for project execution is divided up into seven stages.>\n\n<1596\n\nColin: Yeah, you have a new market, prospecting.>\n\n<1597\n\nGeorge: Let'\''s see, I'\''m trying to think of a good word to describe phase two, or stage two. It'\''s really just land control, and then stage three is more of an activation of SMEs, getting the teams involved.>\n\n<1598\n\nColin: That'\''s engineers in the case, or... Subject matter experts.>\n\n<1599\n\nGeorge: Yep. So that'\''s a variety. They'\''re not just engineers, they'\''re environmental team members, you obviously have civil engineers on there as well.>\n\n<1600\n\nColin: That'\''s awesome. So thanks, that'\''s like a good company overview and then the process. I'\''m curious or I guess zooming in what your role is at Apex then.>\n\n<1601\n\nGeorge: Sure, yeah. after a solar design. So it'\''s my responsibility to lead a team and we work on the layout design energy models for our solar projects.>\n\n<1602\n\nColin: I should be clear. I'\''m not a solar industry expert. I may not know all the the acronyms.>\n\n<1603\n\nGeorge: Yeah, I'\''ll minimize the use of acronyms.>\n\n<1604\n\nColin: I can also just ask it'\''s not a problem. Okay, and you were talking about your role.>\n\n<1605\n\nGeorge: Yeah, yeah, that'\''s that'\''s the large part of it is energy models and the layout design that we mature pre-construction on the pre-construction side.>\n\n<1606\n\nColin: Like if maybe across those seven steps or maybe there'\''s different people who are sort of overseeing that at different points.>\n\n<1607\n\nGeorge: Yeah, yeah, we have we have different teams that well, we'\''re a functional organization So we have different team managers that manage their functional groups There is also, you know a handoff between Development another team that is dedicated to maturing the projects through construction.>\n\n<1608\n\nColin: Purely from the design forward are they all all the way back at stage one or two as well Really from the design forward.>\n\n<1609\n\nGeorge: Yeah, there'\''s not there'\''s um since projects can span multiple years Like we did a ribbon cutting ceremony for a project in Texas and the leasing for that project started in 2018, so about six years ago.>\n\n<1610\n\nColin: Okay, so then I guess I'\''m curious how you or your colleagues at Apex like track a project? How is that done?>\n\n<1611\n\nGeorge: Oh, I mean, we developed a use something like Smartsheets to Smartsheets is an online, you know, like shared workbook in which we manage the project portfolio data.>\n\n<1612\n\nColin: Okay, cool. And so you said that'\''s an internal tool, I guess you'\''ve developed it sounds like.>\n\n<1613\n\nGeorge: No, no, no, that'\''s that'\''s just that'\''s publicly available. Yeah, that'\''s. Oh, understood that you So yeah, yeah, you craft it however you like to use it and Yeah, okay, sorry.>\n\n<1614\n\nColin: I thought you said you developed something like smart sheets So it'\''s sounded like you had seen smart sheets and improved it, but that'\''s not the case.>\n\n<1615\n\nGeorge: Certainly as it has its benefits it'\''s It'\''s an easy to use software because of the depth of complexity it reaches a lot of people so you can have You example, you know programming your own platform would be probably a lot cleaner But the the less people would be able to use it because the depth of complexity Or like the user ceiling is much higher So because something like smart sheets is very approachable from like a layman up to a master, you know It'\''s like working in Excel just online>\n\n<1616\n\nColin: Can you tell me anything about why you felt the need to develop internal tools rather than take some Apex off the shelf?>\n\n<1617\n\nGeorge: really just want to have ownership so that we could craft it exactly how we want it to. A lot of tools that exist out there don'\''t do exactly what you need them to as well.>\n\n<1618\n\nColin: Are there any other, what kind of things did you end up developing internal tools for? Is it for really specific things like this PVSYST improvement you just talked about, or is it possible?>\n\n<1619\n\nGeorge: Some calculations have been expedited by developing certain tools. I can'\''t go into those. Mapping is a big one. So having a digital database in which we store our difference.>\n\n<1620\n\nColin: Okay. I guess, thinking about these seven steps again, I'\''m curious like at Apex, how was the project, I guess, kind of come to life?>\n\n<1621\n\nGeorge: Like, how was it born?>\n\n<1622\n\nColin: What'\''s the first kind of milestone or checkpoint, if you will, where you decide like, this is now a thing, this is a project and before it wasn'\''t?>\n\n<1623\n\nGeorge: mean, it starts really with transmission and capacity in the market. So, knowing where you'\''re allowed to inject power onto the grid, whether it'\''s availability or space.>\n\n<1624\n\nColin: Yeah, yeah the project>\n\n<1625\n\nGeorge: is largely fully an opportunity by the time it reaches our team. By the time the project is ready to be presented, we'\''ll have a preliminary layout available to look at and review the system designed from a very, very high level.>\n\n<1626\n\nColin: Gotcha. in terms of communication, how does it work? I guess when you'\''re dealing with state EPCs, are you sharing information with external experts that you need to share with or get information from them?>\n\n<1627\n\nGeorge: We use various CRM, CRM'\''s, customer, What is CRM, customer CRM systems, know, box, what is it, stand for, remember, like the most common ones that people use are, what did I lose you, the most common ones that people use I think are salesforce or this kind of thing?>\n\n<1628\n\nColin: no, we don'\''t use salesforce.>\n\n<1629\n\nGeorge: Procore, stuff like that. It'\''s like really all you need is data, like a data transforming station that is, because you know, I'\''ll look as a 25 megabyte limit, so you need something higher than that.>\n\n<1630\n\nColin: Okay. And so if someone say an EPC needs to get some information from you, you would do that through Procore?>\n\n<1631\n\nGeorge: It'\''s the median in which we would send the information. I got you.>\n\n<1632\n\nColin: Okay. And the files would I get to be somewhere or the information would be somewhere on your side? right.>\n\n<1633\n\nGeorge: The decision was made well before my time here.>\n\n<1634\n\nColin: Okay. And how do you feel about using Smartsheets yourself? it, uh, how was it?>\n\n<1635\n\nGeorge: Um, I mean, it'\''s, it'\''s fine. use it, I use it daily for a handful of functions. Um, it'\''s, again, it'\''s, it'\''s really an online workbook.>\n\n<1636\n\nColin: And is there anything, uh, you don'\''t have to share your screen, but is there anything you can share about those places where it was, I guess, lacking.>\n\n<1637\n\nGeorge: Yeah, when we were using Smartsheets for to upload certain types of data and revision control for the data was getting really, really difficult to try and manage.>\n\n<1638\n\nColin: Is there anything, guess, in terms of tracking where a project is at in its life cycle and getting a status update on something, that where would you go to to get that information?>\n\n<1639\n\nGeorge: have a project that gives us intel on where a project is at. So all that'\''s managed by different people throughout our organization.>\n\n<1640\n\nColin: And since you'\''re, I guess, you'\''re leading a team of people, I'\''m wondering how I can do that topic a little bit.>\n\n<1641\n\nGeorge: You know time to execute tasks. I'\''m not I won'\''t go into that detail very very much.>\n\n<1642\n\nColin: We'\''ll pass on that one No problem So I guess zooming out Is there anything that sort of like keeps you up at night like just thinking about like problems in?>\n\n<1643\n\nGeorge: Yeah, the thorn in your side so to speak Or maybe there'\''s multiple Yeah, um optimization is one that we always kind of That'\''s never it'\''s truly never solved often optimizing a project design The biggest one The biggest one that'\''s difficult to solve right now is grading And this will this will continuously be an issue.>\n\n<1644\n\nColin: Gotcha. That'\''s, I guess, more on the technical side of things. I'\''m also curious if there'\''s any workflow or more process side of things where you feel like, you know,>\n\n<1645\n\nGeorge: Can you repeat the question in a slightly different way?>\n\n<1646\n\nColin: So essentially I asked before about the thorn in your side and you told me about the technical side of things.>\n\n<1647\n\nGeorge: As far as process goes? Yeah.>\n\n<1648\n\nColin: Like anything that maybe slows things down or is like a bottleneck for you or is like a barrier to good communication internally or with external people?>\n\n<1649\n\nGeorge: Nothing I can think of actually. I think our processes are pretty pretty clean. Transparency communication at Apex is something that we really strive for.>\n\n<1650\n\nColin: Okay, makes sense. And so I guess thinking specifically about like what a direct comes to you and your team, it sounds like everything is pretty smooth there or like any examples of where like you think things could have been cleaner or done better.>\n\n<1651\n\nGeorge: I mean I think it'\''s really just you know helping establish expectations with the with the group previously and as long as everyone'\''s on the same page with what the quality of a project needs to be prior to meeting into this next stage then we'\''re all in alignment then there'\''s there'\''s no shocks if the project isn'\''t ready because it hasn'\''t reached a certain metric that'\''s already been established then um then they'\''re you know no one should be shocked by by the results of the analysis if we need to keep it into a particular stage or you know the project conversely is allowed to progress for them.>\n\n<1652\n\nColin: Like it sounds pretty important. So I guess, how are you doing? I have no idea how we would get better, more accurate data.>\n\n<1653\n\nGeorge: Like the GIS team that we have right now has, you know, access and databases to the best available, the best paid data that is available.>\n\n<1654\n\nColin: Okay, and what about, I guess, so when an EPC is working on a project with you, is that something, how are you tracking the status there?>\n\n<1655\n\nGeorge: Again, Procore is really just used as a medium to transfer information. I mean, you can also mark up notes there, but it'\''s not really a platform in which notes and collaborations is maintained.>\n\n<1656\n\nColin: And how, how then would you interface, guess, with the project management team to get the info you need from, say, off to them, just neither go down to their office, I'\''m remote, but, you know, I would call them up on teams or, I guess, we all zoom.>\n\n<1657\n\nGeorge: Interfacing means.>\n\n<1658\n\nColin: And are you actually, that reminds me, I'\''m quite co-located there in in Atlanta or is it kind of a mixture?>\n\n<1659\n\nGeorge: No, So, Charlesville, Virginia is where the headquarters are located. That'\''s the Apex Plaza. And I got hired on during the pandemic.>\n\n<1660\n\nColin: Gotcha. Okay. I think that'\''s probably it from my side. I'\''m going to quickly check with my colleagues to see if there'\''s any questions.>\n\n<1661\n\nGeorge: Particularly needing from them and how are you doing that also just face-to-face or I I mean face-to-face as much as like teams can'\''t allow since right again, we'\''re all remote, but I'\''m yeah, we meet multiple times a week>\n\n<1662\n\nColin: Alright, I think that'\''s all the questions from my side. I know you had different expectations for what the call would be.>\n\n<1663\n\nGeorge: Um, I mean, it says chat with PV case. I thought that this was a like a feedback session to provide the PV case team with what types of improvements that they could have for their software that we use.>\n\n<1664\n\nColin: Okay, we'\''re basically a research experts and they'\''ve hired us to help with this project. So we'\''re working directly with them and have been for a couple months now.>\n\n<1665\n\nGeorge: Okay.>\n\n<1666\n\nColin: I can definitely try and set that up with you and speak to the right people.>\n\n<1667\n\nGeorge: I'\''m just doing it as a as a favor to PV to the PV case team, but this is this is fine as well.>\n\n<1668\n\nColin: didn'\''t come on No, that'\''s all for today and I want to thank you a lot for your time. It'\''s helpful Cool right on.>",
