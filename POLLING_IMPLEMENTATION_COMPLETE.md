# Polling System Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED: Two-Endpoint Polling System

### New Endpoints Added:

#### 1. `POST /request` - Start Analysis
- **Purpose**: Initiate analysis with sync attempt, fallback to async
- **Features**:
  - Tries 40-second sync processing for small content (<10K chars)
  - Falls back to async queue for large content or timeout
  - Returns immediate results for fast processing
  - Returns job_id for polling when queued

#### 2. `GET /response/{job_id}` - Get Results  
- **Purpose**: Retrieve analysis results by job ID
- **Features**:
  - Returns complete results when ready
  - Returns processing status while in progress
  - Returns error details if failed
  - 24-hour result storage

### Updated Components:

#### ✅ Models (`src/shared/models.py`)
- Added `PollingRequest` model (no webhook URL required)
- Added conversion method to `AnalysisRequest`

#### ✅ Web Service (`src/web/main.py`)
- Added both polling endpoints
- Kept existing webhook endpoints for backward compatibility
- Added synchronous processing for small content

#### ✅ Job Queue (`src/worker/job_queue.py`)
- Added `store_result()` method for polling access
- Added `get_job_result()` method for result retrieval
- 24-hour result storage with Redis

#### ✅ Worker (`src/worker/worker.py`) 
- Updated to store results for both webhook and polling modes
- Handles jobs without webhook URLs (polling-only)
- Stores error results for failed jobs

### Benefits Delivered:

✅ **Simple Coda Integration**: Two button formulas instead of webhook complexity
✅ **No Webhook Complexity**: Eliminates payload parsing and record matching  
✅ **User Control**: Users decide when to check results
✅ **Faster for Small Content**: Returns immediately if Claude responds quickly
✅ **Better Error Handling**: Failed requests can be easily retried
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing webhook system still works

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy to Render** - Push changes to trigger deployment
2. **Test Endpoints** - Use `test_polling.sh` script to verify functionality  
3. **Create Coda Formulas** - Build the two-button system in Coda
4. **Test End-to-End** - Verify complete Coda → Render → Results workflow

## Deployment Commands:

```bash
# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add polling endpoints for Coda integration"
git push origin main

# Test after deployment
chmod +x test_polling.sh
./test_polling.sh
```

The polling system is now ready for Coda integration!
